      \item {[!hide]} or [.] skips the test by default. ''[.mytag]'' for
        example.
      \item {[!mayfail]} -- don't fail the test (but still report). ``Expected to fail''
      \item {[!shouldfail]} -- as above, but \emph{fails} the test if it passes.
      \item etc...

Note the support for {\bf Ease of use}: it's easy to run the
executable, and easy to run selected subsets of the test suite.

Also, note that the test is (mostly) silent, and produces output only
relevent to failures.

\begin{frame}[fragile,t]
\frametitle{Testing Floating Point}
\framesubtitle{}
This may be obvious, but it bears repeating:
{\scriptsize\
\begin{verbatim}
TEST_CASE( "Floating Point Division") {
  REQUIRE ( (1.0/3.0) * 3 == 3 );
}
\end{verbatim}}
is a bad idea. Catch2 provides a mechanism for this:
{\scriptsize\
\begin{verbatim}
TEST_CASE( "Floating Point Division") {
  REQUIRE ( (1.0/3.0) * 3 == Approx(3) );
}
\end{verbatim}}
where the \texttt{Approx} class can take arguments to control the comparison.
 Good frameworks have a set of floating-point
``approximately equals-to'' assertions of the $\Delta < \epsilon$
variety:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Consider making adapters for user-defined mathematical types
    (e.g. Vectors) so they are similarly supported by the framework.
  \item Proceed with care!  Consider if ``approximately the same to
    within $\epsilon$'' means
\begin{itemize}
  \item Relative error?
  \item Absolute error?
  \item Units-of-Last-Place (ULP) error?  (used for looking
    specifically at floating-point roundoff).
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\frametitle{Testing Edge Cases Modes}
Test edge cases, including values at the edges of the domain.
{\scriptsize\begin{verbatim}
int factorial(int n)
{
  if (n < 0)
    throw (std::range_error("Factorial of negative number"));

  if (n > 12) return std::numeric_limits<int>::max();

  if (n == 0) return 1;

  return n * factorial(n-1);
}


TEST_CASE("Factorial success") {
  REQUIRE( factorial(0)  == 1 );
  REQUIRE( factorial(1)  == 1 );
  REQUIRE( factorial(5)  == 120 );
  REQUIRE( factorial(12) == 479001600 );   // this is as big as an int can go

}
\end{verbatim}}

Note: the domain of our function is [0, 12].  We have tested both
edges, the ``interesting'' cases ($0! = 1$), and one in the middle.

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile,t]
\frametitle{Testing Failure Modes}
\framesubtitle{}
It is even more important to test failure modes -- make sure it fails,
in the right way, for the right reasons.
{\scriptsize\begin{verbatim}
int factorial(int n)
{
  if (n < 0)                                 TEST_CASE("Factorial error condition") {    
    throw (std::range_error())                 REQUIRE_THROWS(    factorial(-1) );          
  if (n > 12)                                  REQUIRE_THROWS_AS( factorial(-1) ,        
    return std::numeric_limits<int>::max();                       std::range_error);                    
  if (n == 0) return 1;                        REQUIRE( factorial(13) ==                 
  return n * factorial(n-1);                         std::numeric_limits<int>::max() );  
}                                              REQUIRE( factorial(13) == factorial(14) );
\end{verbatim}}

This test case fails if:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Calling factorial (-1) throws something other than std::range\_error 
  \item Succeeds (doesn't throw anything) 
  \item Calling factorial (13) returns 1932053504 (which is what you get on my laptop after integer overflow -- 
  the answer is 6227020800) rather than max int.
\end{itemize}

That is to say, the unit test \emph{fails} if the function \emph{doesn't} fail the right way.  This can be confusing.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[fragile,t]
\frametitle{Testing Abstract Base Classes (ABCs)}
\framesubtitle{the problem}
Consider:
{\scriptsize\
\begin{verbatim}
class AbstractBase {
  public:

  virtual int PureVirtual () = 0

  int NonVirtualSquare(int i) {
    return i*i;
  }
};

class Widget : public AbstractBase; // non-abstract
class Wicket : public AbstractBase; // "
\end{verbatim}}
How do I unit test the NonVirtualSquare method?
{\scriptsize\
\begin{verbatim}
\\in AbstractBase_test.cpp

TEST( AbstractBase_test, NVSquareTest {
  AbstractBase i;  // oops! compile error
  ASSERT_EQ( i.square(5), 25 );
}
\end{verbatim}}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile,t]
\frametitle{Testing ABC's}
\framesubtitle{the solution?}
You could test in one of the derived classes:
{\scriptsize\
\begin{verbatim}
// in Widget_test.cpp

TEST( WidgetTest, NVSquareTest {
  Widget i;  // ok
  ASSERT_EQ( i.square(5), 25 );
}
\end{verbatim}}
... but a failure shows up in Widget's test suite, not in
AbstractBase's test suite where it belongs.  Widget's test suite
fails, but Widget isn't incorrect.

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile,t]
\frametitle{Testing ABC's}
\framesubtitle{the solution!}
Instead, derive a test class for the purpose:
{\scriptsize\
\begin{verbatim}
// in AbstractBase_test.cpp  (the AbstractBase's test suite)

class AbstractBaseTester : public AbstractBase {
  virtual int PureVirtual () { ... } // some implementation 
};

TEST( AbstractBaseTest, NVSquareTest {
  AbstractBaseTester i;  // ok
  ASSERT_EQ( i.square(5), 25 );
}
\end{verbatim}}
The tester class is only visible in the unit test, and allows all the
functionality of the abstract base class to be exercised.

  bool Drink();   // Empties completely, "
};

\end{verbatim}}

Side note: the interface is interesting, in that:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Filling a full cup is not an error, it's just a failure
    (wastes beer).
  \item Drinking from an empty cup is not an error, it's just
    dissapointing.

Without reaching into the Cup class and examining internal state:

\frametitle{White-Box Pros and Cons}

Cons:
\begin{itemize}
\item Tests are tightly coupled to implementation.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Changing the implementation breaks the unit tests.
  \item Keeping the unit tests working is an increased maintenance burden.
\end{itemize}
\item Tests no longer document the correct way to use a class
\item Tests can get much more complicated
\item Test authors are no longer bound by the class interface,
  reducing the pressure to improve a bad interface design.
\end{itemize}

Pros:
\begin{itemize}
\item Eash access to internal state makes tests easy to write
\item Requires very minor changes to code
\item Doesn't require redesign or refactoring
\item For some complex cases, it's the only viable option.
