\frametitle{Summary}
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\item \texttt{type\_traits.h} defines more type traits than would be
  wise to shake a stick at
\begin{itemize}
  \item Pay particular attention to \texttt{enable\_if}.
\end{itemize}
\item \cexpr is \emph{the} way to do compile-time value computations.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Prefer over recursive templates in all cases.
\end{itemize}
\item Variadic templates
\begin{itemize}
  \item \Emph{Wow}.  Or \Emph{Ouch}.  Or both.
\end{itemize}
\item Universal References and Perfect Forwarding.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Solutions to problems you didn't know you had (but you'd find
    out the hard way).

\frametitle{Encouragement}
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\item \Emph{This stuff is not academic}
\item Fundamental power-tools for library writers.
\item Fundamental power-tools for non-library writers.
\item Jason Turner: \CC17 game code for Commodore

\item A concern shared amongst many people in the Standards Committee:
\begin{itemize}
  \item People aren't thinking compile-time enough.
  \item Compile-time stuff is \emph{everywhere}
  \item Embedded work is \Emph{particularly} receptive / amenable /
    desperate for these techniques.
