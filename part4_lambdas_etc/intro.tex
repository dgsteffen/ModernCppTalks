\framesubtitle{More than we can possibly cover}

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\item We can't even remotely cover all of it
\item We don't have to:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Scott Meyers, ``Effective STL'', 2001 Addison-Wesley
  \item Sean Parent, ``No Raw Loops'' (talk at A9)
  \item Chandler Carruth, ``Efficiency with Algorithms (talk at CppCon)
  \end{itemize}
\item If you want more detail, or a workshop, we can do that.
\end{itemize}
