Arguably, Data Structures and Algorithms are the fundamentals of programming.
Or perhaps, DS&A is the \emph{entirety} of programming.

in 1993 Alex Stepanov presented the ``Standard Template Library'' to
the \CC Standardization Committee.  This revolutionized C++ (early
template semantics were influenced by it), revolutionized library
design.
