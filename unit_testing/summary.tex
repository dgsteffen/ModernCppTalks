\begin{itemize}
\item TEST!
\begin{itemize}
  \item even if it's more work (it isn't)
  \item even if it slows you down (it doesn't)
\end{itemize}
\pause{}
\item Write good tests when you can, bad tests when you can't, any
  test at all is better than none.
\pause{}
\item Listen to the experts (go watch the video again, take it to heart).
\pause{}
\item Write the test before you fix the bug (or write the code)
\pause{}
\item Let the requirement of testability guide your design
\item Prefer black-box testing (with necessary redesigns)
\item White-box test when you have to.
\end{itemize}

\Emph{Without testing we have no proof our code works, or that it will
  continue to work in the face of inevitable change.}

Or at least, prepare to put in a lot of late nights.

%% \item<1-> Don't make unnecessary copies.
%% \item[]<1-> {\scriptsize\begin{verbatim}void foo (shared_ptr<Bar> b); ;\end{verbatim}}
%% \item<2-> To work with the object, \emph{Pass the object itself by
%%   const\&}.  This is agnostic to object lifetime.
%% \item<3-> To observe the smart pointer, pass by const\& to \texttt{shared\_ptr}. (Why?)
%% \note Probably to preserve polymorphic behavior. shared\_ptr
%% guarantees it doesn't go out of scope 
%% \item<4-> To participate in object lifetime, either
%%   \begin{itemize}
%%     \item Pass \texttt{shared\_ptr const\&} and make a copy, or
%%     \item Pass by value and use that copy.  (See copy elision)
%%   \end{itemize}

%%   to something nefarious.)}
%% % Herb's example: take by non-const&, grab a & to the object, reseat
%% % the shared_ptr -- if it was the last owner, boom.

%% - No delete, so don't write new
