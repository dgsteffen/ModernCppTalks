\frametitle{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\item This presentation is entirely about templates as they existed in
\CC98.
\vskip 12pt
\item This is all pre-\CC11.
\vskip 12pt

\item Everything should apply to the VxWorks 6.9 development
  environment.

\vskip 12pt

\item Metaprogramming is a big topic; we're going to just touch on
  common idioms and techniques.
\vskip 12pt
\item There are a lot of obscure corners of the language that end up
  getting used, and the results can be grungy.
\vskip 12pt
\item Remember that templates weren't designed for this. Much of what
  \CC11, \CC14, and \CC17 bring us is better ways to do this. 
\end{itemize}
