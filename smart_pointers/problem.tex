Single-Entry-Single-Exit is an attempt to mitigate this problem:

Heavily nested if-blocks:

\framesubtitle{If you don't know what you're doing}
In the presence of exceptions, writing code the old way is nearly impossible:
{\scriptsize\
\begin{verbatim}
void foo() {
  try {  double* d = new double[70]; }
  catch (...) {...}
  ...
  try { foo(); }
  catch (...) { delete d; ...}

  try { bar(); } 
  catch (...) { delete d; ...}

  delete d;      // cleanup
}
\end{verbatim}
}
Every statement must be wrapped in a try/catch block... this is part
of the reason exceptions have a bad rap in C++.
\vskip 6pt
(If you're handling exceptions by writing try and catch everwhere,
you're doing it wrong -- but that's another talk)
