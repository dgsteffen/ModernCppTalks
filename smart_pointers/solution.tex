\begin{itemize}
\item Smart pointers are a specific case of a more general idiom, ``RAII''
\item Developed to manage resources in the presence of exceptions, but
  they are much more widely useful.
\item The key idea:  \Emph{Tie resource management to object lifetime}
\item Resource manager objects receive the resource in their
  ctor, and release it in their dtor.  Emphasis:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Allocate resource in constructor (at initialization)
  \item Release resources in destructor (at scope exit)
\end{itemize}
\item Normal scoping rules now ensure proper cleanup.
\item Exceptions cause local variables to be destructed, so no leaks.

The smart pointer object receives a dynamically allocated object in
its ctor, and releases it in the dtor, which executes at scope exit.
